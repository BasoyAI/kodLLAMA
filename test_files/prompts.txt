Analyze the text to identify key areas of concern and categorize sentences under appropriate headings.
Focus on customer complaints, product issues, and website functionality, and create concise, meaningful
headings that summarize each category. Ensure each sentence is placed only in relevant headings. If a sentence
fits multiple categories, list all appropriate headings.
